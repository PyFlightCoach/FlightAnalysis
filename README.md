# FlightAnalysis

WIP Tools for analysing flight log data


# TODO:
- the Sequence class contains sequence frame data, add support for an equivalent body frame Class
- Expand the schedule module to generate a perfect sequence
- detect areas in the box
- calculate angle between wings and the Y axis + other useful juding info
- some of the tests are failing for box definition(I think code is right, tests wrong)
